## Facade Pattern

Facade design pattern says: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. Facade exposes a simplified interface and internally it interacts with those components and gets the job done for you. It can be taken as one level of abstraction over an existing layer.

Facade design pattern is one among the other design patterns that promote loose coupling. It emphasizes one more important aspect of design which is abstraction. By hiding the complexity behind it and exposing a simple interface it achieves abstraction.

`Real world example:`
Consider microwave oven, it consists of components like trasnformer, capacitor, magnetron, waveguide and some more. To perform an operation these different components needs to be activated in a sequence. Every components has different outputs and inputs. In this scenario, oven provides you preprogrammed switches which can be considered as a facade. On click on of a single switch the job gets done. That single menu switch works as an abstraction layer between you and the internal components.
